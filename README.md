# Excel Sorting and Filtering Practice Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Sorting and Filtering features in Google sheets** to organize, analyze, and clean data efficiently.  
It focuses on handling large datasets by arranging data logically and extracting required records using filters.

---

## 🧾 Dataset Details
- Type: Dummy dataset for practice
- Rows: 30
- Contains multiple columns suitable for sorting and filtering
- Includes numeric and text-based data

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Google sheets

---

## 🔧 Excel Features Used

### 1️⃣ Sorting
The following sorting techniques were applied:
- **Ascending order** (A–Z / smallest to largest)
- **Descending order** (Z–A / largest to smallest)
- Sorting based on:
  - Numeric values (e.g., Age, Salary)
  - Text values (e.g., Name, City)

### 2️⃣ Filtering
The following filtering methods were used:
- **AutoFilter**
- Filter by:
  - Specific values
  - Text conditions
  - Numeric conditions (greater than, less than, between)
- Multiple column filtering to narrow down results

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. Selected the complete dataset
2. Applied **Sort** to arrange data in meaningful order
3. Used **Filter** to display required records only
4. Combined sorting and filtering for better data analysis
5. Verified results after each operation
